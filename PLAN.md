# Augmented Reality - uFixit - Project Plan

as part of the advanced seminar at TUM in SS 2016.


1. Introduction (Stefan)
	- problem: "things" get more complicated each day. additionally, these last years, repairing stuff has become nearly impossible.
		- mobilephones get less and less parts > even batteries are not replaceable anymore
		- cars include expensive electronics in every single part
		- soley from machanical party consisting products are most likely made out of cheap irreplaceable plastic parts

	- solution:
		- find a professinal ($$$)
		- repair the thing yourself
			- with the help of the manufacture
				- not really wanted > a repaired product last longer and shrinks profits from selling new product
				- nowadays only for professinal equipment (business laptops, ...)
			- without the help of the manufacture
				- with technical skills > requirements increase drastically
				- with no technical skills > manuals by other users (youtube videos, ...)

	- our new solution:
		- ___help user with repairing things by their own___
		- new approach: use AR
		- WHY
			- AR will come into the houses over the next years > device available
			- AR devices are designed to show/add information to your environment and at the same time keep your hands free (alternation and interaction possible!)
				(not for tablets, ...)
			...

2. Our product: uFixit (Stefan)

	- Overview: designed as a platform: http://pasteboard.co/1PpOALom.jpg

	- Hardware:
		- consumer and helper use AR device > simple and intuitive input
			- uses AR device input! > can be different for each device!
			- must at all cost be intuitive! > limitations
		- manufacture has possiblitly for high quality software
			- 3D CAD models, ...
			- highly customizable
			- animated, ...

	- Possible interactions:
		- manuals from manufature to consumer
		- live support from manufacture to consumer
		- feedback from consumer to manufacture
		- manuals from helpers (Fixers) to consumer
		- live support from helpers (Fixers) to consumer
		- reward system (?), freelancer contracts from manufacture to helpers (Fixers)

3. Realization regarding AR (Manuel)

	- Hardware
		- Glases, Mobile Phone, Tablet

	- Software (computer vison part)
	      - Objekterkennung für Erstellung der Anleitung
			- Zusätzliche Marker für Erkennung ?
			- Feature matching (Nutzer bestimmte Geräteperspektiven vorgeben)
			- Schwierig: Defektes/Deformiertes Gerät erkennen
			- Manuelle Auswahl (?)

	- Software (manual creation, manufacturer)
		- complicated 3D CAD software

	- Software (manual creation, end user)
		- Einbindung von Zeigern, Animationen, Text, ...
		- Fertige Animationen (Schraube die sich raus dreht)
		- Wie im Raum platzieren
		- Prototype concept
			- Example pictures how the software looks like

	-  Live support
		- Highlighting, Arrows, Painting, Audio

4. Conclusion (Firas)

	Business plan:

	    - Clients: who and where/ Categorize them (age, sex, occupation, B2C or B2B...) / references and big clients
	    - Competition: Who / how much does their product cost / their strength & weaknesses / their advantage comparing to us & how to overcome it
	    - Where to offer our product
	    - Marketing
	    - risks and  opportunities
	    - Finance: Capital costs (launch and first days costs: ca 6 months), financing (internal & external investment, credits), liquidity and rentability
