\chapter{uFixit - Concept Description}

	- platform overview
	
	- \url{http://pasteboard.co/1PpOALom.jpg}

	\section{Instructions format}
	
		- how do tutorials look like
	
	\section{Using existing AR hardware devices}
	
		- to use tutorial, but also create them with end user AR devices
	
		- flagship: HMD (Hololens, Meta 2, ...)
		
		- also: Project Tango
	
	\section{Software}
	
		- two approaches: simple CMCS, complex hard to learn 3D CAD software
		
		\subsection{Our gem: Community Manual Creation Software}
		
			- for everyone that owns an AR device
			
			- very intuitive, simple, fool proof
			
			- insert arrows by gestures, ...
	
		\subsection{3D CAD software for manufacturers}
		
			- needs good 3D model
			
			- can contain animations or see through content

			- complicated, only possible with previous training

		\subsection{Use tutorials on the device you like}
		
			- basically bring manual to as many devices as possible
			
			- classical screen
			
			- smartphones, tables with back camera
			
			- AR head mounted devices
